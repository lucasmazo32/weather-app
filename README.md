# About the project

The weather app is a microverse project in which you have to work with APIs. In this case, I chose to add a gif API as well to display for the weather conditions (cloudy, rainy, sunny, etc.). This webpage works better on mobile than for desktop versions; although both of them are virtually the same, the mobile version has a better display, animations, and use of the space. I used the design made by [UI Ninja](https://dribbble.com/shots/10731012-Weather-App-UI) for inspiration. You can see the project specifications [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).
